Perfect. Let me draft that morning note for you:

\*\*QN MORNING NOTE - 2026-01-24\*\*



---



\*\*CURRENT STATE:\*\*

\- MacBook Air: Running archive/dedup pipeline (~160GB processed, continuing)

\- IBISX: Booted, HINENI\_HUB\_PC on E:\\, floppy drive connected

\- Mini PC: Idle (YouTube), hub temporarily moved to IBISX



\*\*WHY HUB ON IBISX:\*\*

\- IBISX only has 2 USB-C + 2 USB-A ports

\- Need extra port for floppy drive

\- Hub provides expansion for both floppy testing AND hub integration work



---



\*\*TODAY'S PRIORITIES:\*\*



1\. \*\*Hub Integration (Morning Checklist)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Verify E:\\HINENI\_HUB\_PC mounted: `Get-ChildItem E:\\ -Directory`

&nbsp;  - Analyze hineni-hub.js for hub-locked items (isLocal: false)

&nbsp;  - Create migration plan for Windows path compatibility



2\. \*\*Floppy Layer Testing\*\*

&nbsp;  - CODEX-ARK bootstrap test on fresh environment

&nbsp;  - Verify all HTML apps load offline

&nbsp;  - Test morning.bat, pranayama, oracle, scrapers

&nbsp;  - Document what works/breaks



3\. \*\*Pearl Demo Setup\*\*

&nbsp;  - Use La Nausée Tohu Vavohu Analysis as demo content

&nbsp;  - Register Pearl properly in portal

&nbsp;  - Sartre existentialism → structured insight example



4\. \*\*Verify MacBook Migration\*\*

&nbsp;  - Check if Pass 1 completed (expect ~12.5TB on CODEX1)

&nbsp;  - Spot check file integrity

&nbsp;  - Plan Pass 2 if successful



---



\*\*DEFERRED:\*\*

\- Push complete floppy toolkit to GitHub (after testing)

\- Mini PC reconnection (after IBISX work done)



---



\*\*CLAUDE CODE STARTER:\*\*

```

Verify E:\\HINENI\_HUB\_PC is mounted and list its top-level directories. Then analyze hineni-hub.js for any hub-locked items (isLocal: false or paths containing '/Volumes/HINENI\_HUB'). List each with name, current path, and what needs updating for Windows compatibility.

```

Want me to adjust anything before you save it and hand off to Claude Code?
