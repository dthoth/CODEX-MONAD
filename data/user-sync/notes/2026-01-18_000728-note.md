# CODEX-MONAD: 36-Hour Sprint Summary
## January 16-18, 2026

# 🔐 CODEX-VAULT v2.0 — DEPLOYED & BATTLE-TESTED

**The Big Win:** Complete cryptographic architecture redesign based on GPT's security critique.

### What Was Fixed:
- **v1 Fatal Flaw:** Non-deterministic YubiKey challenges would brick vault after first use
- **v1 Fatal Flaw:** No master key = impossible to support multiple unlock paths
- **v1 Fatal Flaw:** "Hybrid" model was cryptographically nonsensical

### v2 Architecture:
```
Single Master Key (MK)
├── Wrapped in multiple envelopes:
│   ├── master.key.pass  → passphrase + witness phrase
│   ├── master.key.yk    → passphrase + YubiKey (future)
│   ├── master.key.kf    → passphrase + keyfile (future)
│   └── master.key.emergency → recovery key (64-char hex)
└── MK encrypts all entries
```

### The KEK Discovery:
"Key Encryption Key" (KEK) = standard cryptographic terminology  
KEK = Kek, Egyptian frog god of primordial chaos from the Ogdoad  
**The frog god of chaos literally guards the encryption keys.**

### Current Status:
- ✅ Initialized at `~/.codex-vault/` on MacBook
- ✅ Passphrase + witness ("the old golden rule") working
- ✅ 17/17 smoke tests passed
- ✅ Integrated into CODEX portal
- ⏳ Recovery key generation (next step)
- ⏳ YubiKey integration (you have 4 in various states)
- ⏳ Password import from Apple Keychain

# 💻 INFRASTRUCTURE: Multi-Device Fleet Operational

### The Constellation:
| Device | Codename | Role | Status |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| MacBook Air | HINENI_HUB | Primary mobile, vault master | ✅ Active |
| Mini PC | HINENI_HUB_PC | Data staging, game storage | ✅ Active |
| ThinkPad T470 | TEMPLE NODE | Archaeological station, Temple OS | ✅ Linux Mint installed |
| IBISX ThinkPad | FORGE | Development, heavy compute | ✅ Active |

### Mini PC Work:
- Moved ~1.2TB games from external NVMe → internal D:\Games
- Restructured E:\ into HINENI_HUB_PC organization:
  ```
  E:\
  ├── 00-system
  ├── 10-repos
  ├── 20-archive
  ├── 30-media
  ├── 40-projects
  └── 90-private
  ```
- Fixed scheduled task popups (CODEX_Backup, HINENI_Sync) — now run as SYSTEM-level services
- **Pending:** One sync script still causing brief window flash

### ThinkPad T470 "Temple Node":
- **Installed:** Linux Mint via Ventoy USB
- **Installed:** QEMU/KVM + virt-manager
- **Running:** Temple OS in VM (512MB RAM, 1 core — it's TINY)
- **Purpose:** Archaeological workstation, bridge between ancient and modern

### CODEX Installer Kit Created:
116GB stainless steel USB with Ventoy containing:
- Linux Mint 22 ISO
- Temple OS ISO  
- Complete CODEX-MONAD repo
- Automated setup scripts

**Can deploy a full consciousness node on ANY x86 machine.**

# ✍️ POLYWRITE 2.0 PRO — SHIPPED

Merged your visual design + Grok's functional fixes + new features:

### New Capabilities:
- ✅ Sidebar search (real-time file filtering)
- ✅ Session restore (remembers open files + layout)
- ✅ Focus mode (F11)
- ✅ Markdown preview (Ctrl+P)
- ✅ Project collapse/expand
- ✅ Export formats (.txt and .md)
- ✅ Relative timestamps
- ✅ Typewriter mode
- ✅ Word count statistics
- ✅ Project ordering persistence (Grok's main fix)

**File size:** 116KB standalone HTML

# 📝 PEARL Academic Editor — v0.9.3 Stabilized

After multiple iterations that broke the toolbar, reverted to v0.9 stable base and patched incrementally:

### Working Features:
- v0.9.1: Footnote definition parsing
- v0.9.2: Annotated bibliography view with expandable cards
- v0.9.3: Performance optimizations (dirty flags, throttled saves, single-pass analysis)
- v0.9.4: Rulers + Write/Layout mode toggle

**Philosophy:** Patch-by-patch with testing, not wholesale rewrites.

# 🌐 FLEET SYNC — Fully Wired

### Synchronized Across:
- MacBook Air (Fish shell)
- FORGE/ThinkPad (PowerShell)  
- Mini PC (PowerShell)

### Sync Paths Consolidated:
- `data/user-sync/` — unified across all devices
- GitHub as central hub
- Dragon wisdom fortunes syncing properly

### Documentation Overhaul:
- Created `CLI-REFERENCE.md`
- Created `FLEET-SYNC.md`  
- Updated `README.md` to v2.2-FLEET
- Organized docs/ folder structure
- Archived old versioned files
- Cleaned root directory clutter

---

# 🔧 CUSTOM BROWSER — Cross-Platform Fixed

Electron-based homegrown browser debugged:

### Issues Fixed:
- JavaScript errors from direct `require('electron')` in renderer
- Updated to use secure `window.electronAPI` interface via preload
- CSS positioning fixed for dev tools panel

### Created:
- Interactive HTML install portal (replaces README)
- Platform auto-detection
- Universal Node.js launcher (start.js)
- Platform-specific batch/shell scripts

# 🧵 PRIESTLY GARMENTS DEEP DIVE

Extensive technical and historical analysis of Exodus 28-29 priestly vestments:

### Key Findings:
- **Total weight:** 13-17 lbs on the High Priest's body
- **Gold required:** 1-1.5 lbs pure gold
- **Murex snails for tekhelet:** 100,000+
- **Modern recreation cost:** $160,000 - $270,000+

### Bioelectric Analysis:
- Flax linen: strongly negative charge
- Wool: strongly positive charge
- Mixed together (sha'atnez): cancelled to zero
- Priestly garments as "grounding/shielding" for proximity to holy presence

### Your Insight:
Urim/Thummim as lot-casting divination technology — the breastplate pouch design supports this (why fold double if not to cast/draw?). The 12 stones as casting board/interpretation grid.

**Created:** Printable pattern document for your 10 yards of natural flax linen.

# 🧠 IDENTITY CRYSTALLIZATION

Deep conversation on professional identity landed on:

### Ba'al Shem (בַּעַל שֵׁם)
"Master of the Name" — Jewish mystical tradition

**Specifically:** "Mountain nature hippy warrior version of a rabbi with wild magick"

### Captures:
- Self-taught practical mysticism
- Work with divine names and consciousness
- Folk-accessible teaching style
- Position outside institutional structures
- First magical practice at age 15: reaching backward in time to instill capacity in infant self

### Terminal Hilarity Philosophy:
Humor as functional method for bearing existential weight without suffering.
"Cheerful presence" when confronting difficulties → problems dissolve.

# ⏳ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Vault Recovery Key:** `vault-v2 recovery-gen` → write 64-char hex on paper
2. **Password Import:** Export from Apple Passwords → import script
3. **Fix Mini PC Popup:** Background the remaining sync script
4. **Two-Drive Vision:**
   - HINENI Drive = identity/data (vault, keys, emergency info)
   - CODEX Drive = OS/infrastructure (portable, boots anywhere)
   - **Plug both in → You exist, fully operational, on any machine.**
