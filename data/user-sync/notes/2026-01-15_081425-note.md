Notes on things to fix for gui and things that are working:



now qn goes to notepad which is nice rather than opening to nano as it may on other devices - should fix



it does however now boot gui portal in the default system set browser not our electron one. For now works better.



Tweaks to our browser need to be done for stability and usage.



Most importantly the "tools" it points to are NOT the correct recent working tools we have that work on the other devices portals. For instance, we have two working most recent versions of polywritepro and the one on ibisx loads into the oldest prior used one that is not fully functioning so we can assume that all the other tools except for the most recent ones such as game of ur are correct all other are suspected to be old or broken versions.



Additionally we MUST fix the git pull and push sync to be down from command line properly finally and we MUST fix it so that those work automatically with to go to the CODEX-MONAD then from all devices so we can avoid many of the issues where problems fixed don't sync up.
