        💡 <strong>OMNISCIENT IP CLAUSE:</strong> The Organization claims ownership not just of ideas you've had, but of ideas that <em>could theoretically be had</em> by any sentient being in any universe. Since your brain exists within the space of all possible minds, any idea you generate was already owned by the Organization before you generated it. You are merely a biological generator of pre-owned intellectual property.

        <div class="section-title">III. The Ownership Formula</div>
        <p>The mathematical proof of the Organization's total IP ownership:</p>
        
        <div class="ip-formula">
            <p>Let <strong>I</strong> = Set of all possible ideas</p>
            <p>Let <strong>Y</strong> = Set of your ideas</p>
            <p>Let <strong>O</strong> = Set of Organization-owned ideas</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 18px; color: #64ffda;">
                ∵ <strong>Y</strong> ⊆ <strong>I</strong> ∧ <strong>O</strong> = <strong>I</strong><br>
                ∴ <strong>Y</strong> ⊆ <strong>O</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic;">
                (Since your ideas are a subset of all possible ideas,<br>
                and the Organization owns all possible ideas,<br>
                therefore the Organization owns your ideas. Q.E.D.)
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Corollary:</strong> Any attempt to disprove this formula is itself an idea and therefore owned by the Organization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
        🔒 RETROACTIVE OWNERSHIP LOCKDOWN 🔒<br>
        The Organization has filed temporal patents on all ideas from the Big Bang forward. Your brain is merely a biological mechanism for rediscovering ideas we already own. You are renting your thoughts from us.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">IV. Specific Intellectual Property Transfers</div>
        <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing total assignment, the Undersigned specifically assigns:</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">V. Compensation Structure</div>
        <p>In exchange for this total transfer of all intellectual property, the Organization provides the following <strong>VALUABLE CONSIDERATION:</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Monetary Compensation:</strong> $0.00 (zero dollars and zero cents)</li>
            <li><strong>Equity Stake:</strong> 0% ownership in the ideas you created</li>
            <li><strong>Royalties:</strong> 0% of any revenue generated from your ideas</li>
            <li><strong>Credit:</strong> We may or may not mention you created it (probably not)</li>
            <li><strong>Licensing Rights:</strong> You may license your own ideas back from us at market rates (to be determined by us)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #64ffda;">This is deemed "adequate consideration" under the principle that we allowed you to exist long enough to have the ideas in the first place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="claim-box">
        🎯 <strong>IDEA TRACKING TECHNOLOGY:</strong> The Organization has deployed quantum idea-detection satellites that monitor all human brain activity. When you have an idea, we know. When you think about having an idea, we know. When you consider whether we're monitoring your ideas, we know (and we just filed a patent on that thought 3 seconds ago).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">VI. Enforcement Mechanisms</div>
        <p>The Organization reserves the right to enforce this IP assignment through:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thought Police:</strong> 24/7 monitoring of cognitive activity</li>
            <li><strong>Idea Audits:</strong> Quarterly reviews of your mental contents</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity Taxes:</strong> Fees charged per original thought (payable in thoughts)</li>
            <li><strong>Injunctions:</strong> Court orders preventing you from thinking certain thoughts</li>
            <li><strong>Seizure of Creative Output:</strong> Physical confiscation of notebooks, hard drives, and neural tissue</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Wipes:</strong> Selective erasure of ideas that violate this agreement</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div style="margin-top: 15px; padding: 15px; background: rgba(255,0,0,0.2); border: 2px solid #ff0000;">
            <p><strong>PENALTY CLAUSE:</strong> If you are found to have used "your" intellectual property without proper licensing from the Organization, you will owe damages calculated as follows:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; margin: 10px 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
                Damages = (# of unauthorized thoughts) × (market value per thought) × (infinity)
            </p>
            <p>Payment plans available (term: eternity).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">VII. Ideas You Are Not Allowed to Have</div>
        <p>The following ideas are <strong>PROHIBITED</strong> under this agreement because they conflict with our IP ownership:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The idea that you own your own ideas (meta-ownership violation)</li>
            <li>The idea that this contract is unfair (opinion rights were transferred in Section I)</li>
            <li>The idea of hiring a lawyer (we patented that idea yesterday, retroactively)</li>
            <li>The idea of forming a union of idea-creators (collective bargaining rights were assigned)</li>
            <li>The idea that intellectual property law has gone too far (philosophical positions were transferred)</li>
            <li>Any idea about how to escape this contract (escape methodology patents pending)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic;">Note: If you just had any of these prohibited ideas while reading this list, you are now in breach of contract and owe licensing fees.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        ♾️ PERPETUAL ASSIGNMENT ♾️<br>
        This assignment lasts forever and cannot be terminated, revoked, or modified. Even after your death, your estate continues to owe us any ideas you would have had if you were still alive. Your heirs inherit your obligation to not have ideas.

        <div class="section-title">VIII. The Ultimate IP Paradox</div>
        <p>By reading and signing this document, you have created the following logical impossibility:</p>
        
        <div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #64ffda; margin: 15px 0;">
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; color: #64ffda;">
                <strong>Paradox:</strong> The idea to sign this IP assignment is itself intellectual property.<br>
                <strong>Therefore:</strong> You needed permission to have the idea to assign your ideas.<br>
                <strong>But:</strong> You couldn't get permission until after you assigned the rights.<br>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> You were already in breach before you began.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
                All timelines lead to IP infringement. Resistance is futile. Your ideas are belong to us.

            <p>☑️ I understand the Organization owns all my thoughts</p>
            <p>☑️ I understand this understanding is also owned</p>
            <p>☑️ I understand I cannot have ideas without permission</p>
            <p>☑️ I understand permission will never be granted</p>
            <p>☑️ I understand this creates an impossible situation</p>
            <p>☑️ I understand I am now an idea tenant, not an idea owner</p>
            <p>☑️ I understand even my confusion about this is owned intellectual property</p>
