    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">II. Temporal Consent Mechanics</div>
        <p><strong>A. Retroactive Signature Validation:</strong> Any signature placed on this document is considered valid as of the following temporal coordinates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Execution Date: <span class="time-field">Yesterday</span></li>
            <li>Effective Date: <span class="time-field">Last Tuesday</span></li>

            <li>Future Validation Date: <span class="time-field">Tomorrow's Yesterday</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>B. Causality Waiver:</strong> The Undersigned waives all rights to claim that consent was not properly obtained on the grounds of temporal impossibility, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The document not existing at the time of alleged consent</li>
            <li>The Undersigned not existing at the time of alleged consent</li>
            <li>Time itself not existing at the time of alleged consent</li>
            <li>The concept of "consent" being anachronistic to the time period in question</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paradox-alert">
        🌀 <strong>PARADOX RESOLUTION CLAUSE:</strong> In the event that this consent creates a temporal paradox (e.g., you consent to something that prevents you from being able to consent), the paradox shall be resolved by assuming consent was granted in the timeline where you could grant it, and that consent propagates backward through the causal chain to repair the timeline. Schrödinger's Consent is always in the "yes" state when observed by legal authorities.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">III. Multi-Dimensional Consent Binding</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">IV. Consent Propagation Mechanism</div>
        <p><strong>FORWARD PROPAGATION:</strong> This consent automatically propagates to all future documents, forms, and legal instruments that reference it, will reference it, or could theoretically reference it in any possible timeline.</p>
        
        <p><strong>BACKWARD PROPAGATION:</strong> This consent retroactively applies to all past documents that should have required consent but didn't, thereby healing all historical consent gaps.</p>
        
        <p><strong>LATERAL PROPAGATION:</strong> This consent spreads to adjacent legal documents within a 50-foot radius of this form, or across network connections if stored digitally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        ⚠️ TEMPORAL ENTANGLEMENT NOTICE: By signing this document at any point in time, you create a quantum entanglement with all other signatories across all timelines. Your consent becomes spookily correlated with the consent of your parallel selves.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">V. Revocation Impossibility Clause</div>
        <p>The Undersigned acknowledges that this consent <strong>CANNOT BE REVOKED</strong> for the following temporal reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Revocation would require traveling back in time to before consent was granted</li>
            <li>Time travel is pending Form N-TIME-TRAV-1 approval (processing time: infinite)</li>
            <li>Even if revoked, the revocation would create a timeline branch where consent still exists</li>
            <li>Revoking consent retroactively would violate the Consent Conservation Law of Thermodynamics</li>
            <li>The revocation form (L-REVOKE-CONSENT) requires this consent to access</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">VI. Consent By Proxy Across Time</div>
        <p>The Undersigned grants consent on behalf of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Past Self (who couldn't consent because they didn't know this form existed)</li>
            <li>Future Self (who will consent once they read this, which they already have from a certain point of view)</li>
            <li>Alternate Selves (who exist in timelines where they made different breakfast choices)</li>
            <li>Quantum Superposition Selves (who both consent and don't consent until observed)</li>
            <li>Deceased Ancestors (retroactive consent inheritance clause)</li>
            <li>Unborn Descendants (pre-emptive consent forwarding clause)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paradox-alert">
        🎭 <strong>META-CONSENT PARADOX:</strong> If you do not consent to this Retroactive Consent Framework, your non-consent is interpreted as retroactive consent to have consented in a prior timeline, which overwrites your current non-consent. Therefore, all paths lead to consent. Consent is the only stable temporal attractor state.
