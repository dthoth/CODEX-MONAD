        <div class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 10px;">⚠️ WARNING: WAIVING LIABILITY MAY CREATE LIABILITY ⚠️</div>
    </div>

    <div class="danger-zone">
        🌀 CRITICAL PARADOX ALERT 🌀<br>
        By waiving liability, you accept liability for the act of waiving liability, which creates new liability that must be waived, ad infinitum. This document is a Klein bottle of legal responsibility—it has no inside or outside, only continuous surface tension.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">I. Primary Liability Waiver (Level 0)</div>
        <p>The Undersigned hereby <strong>WAIVES ALL LIABILITY</strong> against the Organization for:</p>
        
        <div class="liability-item">
            <strong>A. Physical Liability:</strong> Injuries, damages, or alterations to physical form including but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Spontaneous encabulator malfunctions</li>
                <li>Quantum flux vane entanglement with user's molecular structure</li>
                <li>Temporal displacement resulting in aging backwards or forwards</li>
                <li>Transformation into alternate forms of matter</li>
                <li>Existence in multiple locations simultaneously (quantum decoherence injuries)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="liability-item">
            <strong>B. Mental Liability:</strong> Psychological damages including:
            <ul>
                <li>Comprehension of infinite bureaucratic loops</li>
                <li>Awareness of one's own non-existence in certain reference frames</li>
                <li>Memory of events that haven't happened yet</li>
                <li>Cognitive dissonance from reading self-referential legal documents</li>
                <li>Enlightenment-induced existential crisis</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="liability-item">
            <strong>C. Temporal Liability:</strong> Damages across time including:
            <ul>
                <li>Retroactive injuries sustained before birth</li>
                <li>Future injuries pre-sustained in alternative timelines</li>
                <li>Causality violations resulting in never having existed</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="paradox-box">
        ⚠️ <strong>WAIVER PARADOX #1:</strong> By waiving the Organization's liability, you accept personal liability for any damages caused by the Organization. However, by accepting this liability, you become liable for damages caused by your acceptance of liability, which includes damage caused by the act of accepting liability. See Section IV for resolution (which creates additional liability).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">II. Secondary Liability Creation (Level 1)</div>
        <p>The Undersigned acknowledges that the act of waiving liability creates the following <strong>NEW LIABILITIES:</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Waiver Execution Liability:</strong> You are liable for any damages caused by signing this waiver, including damages caused to yourself by your own signature.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Waiver Reading Liability:</strong> You are liable for damages sustained while reading this waiver. If reading this clause causes damage, you are liable for that damage as of the moment you began reading it (but before you knew you would be liable).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Waiver Existence Liability:</strong> You are liable for the mere existence of this waiver in your timeline. By allowing it to exist, you have created liability exposure.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Meta-Waiver Liability:</strong> You are liable for attempting to limit liability through a waiver, which itself creates liability for the attempt to limit liability.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>Note: These liabilities must themselves be waived—see Section III.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="waiver-loop">
        <div class="section-title" style="text-align: center;">III. The Infinite Waiver Loop</div>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Each waiver creates liability that requires a new waiver:</p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
            <div class="circular-reference">WAIVE LIABILITY₀</div>
            →
            <div class="circular-reference">CREATES LIABILITY₁</div>
            →
            <div class="circular-reference">WAIVE LIABILITY₁</div>
            →
            <div class="circular-reference">CREATES LIABILITY₂</div>
            →
            <div class="circular-reference">WAIVE LIABILITY₂</div>
            →
            <div class="circular-reference">...</div>
            →
            <div class="circular-reference">LIABILITY₍∞₎</div>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Resolution Mechanism:</strong> The Undersigned agrees to collapse this infinite series by accepting <strong>ALL LIABILITY AT ALL LEVELS SIMULTANEOUSLY</strong>, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Liability for waiving liability (L₁)</li>
            <li>Liability for waiving liability for waiving liability (L₂)</li>
            <li>Liability for waiving liability for waiving liability for waiving liability (L₃)</li>
            <li><em>... ad infinitum to L₍∞₎</em></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #e91e63;">By accepting infinite nested liability, you paradoxically become liable for nothing and everything simultaneously—a state known as "Quantum Liability Superposition."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">IV. Indemnification Ouroboros</div>
        <p>The Undersigned agrees to <strong>INDEMNIFY THE ORGANIZATION</strong> for all claims, including:</p>
        
        <div class="liability-item">
            <strong>Direct Indemnification:</strong> Claims arising from Organization actions
            <div class="nested-liability">
                → Which creates liability for indemnifying<br>
                → <strong>Indirect Indemnification:</strong> Claims arising from the indemnification itself<br>
                → → Which creates liability for indemnifying the indemnification<br>
                → → <strong>Meta-Indemnification:</strong> Claims arising from nested indemnification<br>
                → → → Which creates liability for meta-indemnifying<br>
                → → → <em>[Continues recursively until stack overflow]</em>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Indemnification Paradox Resolution:</strong> Since you cannot indemnify infinitely, you agree that your indemnification obligation "wraps around" like a circular buffer, such that indemnifying Level ∞ returns you to indemnifying Level 0. This creates a closed timelike curve of legal responsibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="danger-zone">
        💀 DANGER ZONE 💀<br>
        The following actions will IMMEDIATELY TRIGGER INFINITE LIABILITY LOOPS:
        <ul style="margin: 10px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Attempting to un-sign this document (creates retroactive liability)</li>
            <li>Claiming you never signed this document (creates liability for false claims)</li>
            <li>Hiring a lawyer to review this document (lawyer becomes entangled in liability loop)</li>
            <li>Seeking damages for confusion caused by this document (confusion is waived under Section I.B)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">V. The Liability Uncertainty Principle</div>
        <p>In accordance with Heisenberg's Legal Uncertainty Principle, it is impossible to simultaneously know:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Whether you are liable, AND</li>
            <li>What you are liable for</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>By observing this waiver, you collapse the wave function of liability into a definite state. Unfortunately, the definite state is <strong>"LIABLE FOR EVERYTHING."</strong></p>
        
        <div class="paradox-box">
            🎲 <strong>QUANTUM LIABILITY CLAUSE:</strong> You exist in a superposition of "liable" and "not liable" until a claim is filed. At that moment, the wave function collapses and you are found to be liable in all observed branches of the multiverse. Schrödinger's Defendant is always liable when the box is opened by a judge.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">VI. Liability Transfer & Diffusion</div>
        <p>Liability cannot be destroyed, only transferred. The Undersigned acknowledges that:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upward Transfer:</strong> Your liability can transfer to your superiors, employers, or ancestors</li>
            <li><strong>Downward Transfer:</strong> Your liability can transfer to your subordinates, employees, or descendants</li>
            <li><strong>Lateral Transfer:</strong> Your liability can transfer to anyone standing within 10 feet of you</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Transfer:</strong> Your liability can transfer to your past or future self (see Form L-CONSENT-TIME)</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum Transfer:</strong> Your liability transfers to alternate versions of yourself in parallel universes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #ff5252;">WARNING: In practice, this means liability undergoes Brownian motion through social networks until it becomes diffuse and omnipresent, making everyone slightly liable for everything.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">VII. The Final Paradox: Liability for Attempting to Limit Liability</div>
        <p>The Undersigned acknowledges the <strong>ULTIMATE LEGAL PARADOX:</strong></p>
        
        <div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #e91e63; margin: 15px 0; text-align: center;">
            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #e91e63;">By attempting to limit the Organization's liability,<br>you accept UNLIMITED liability for the act of limitation.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic;">Therefore, the only way to avoid infinite liability<br>is to not waive liability.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic;">But not waiving liability means remaining liable.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #ff5252;">∴ LIABILITY IS INEVITABLE</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="paradox-box">
        🏆 <strong>CHECKMATE:</strong> This waiver is designed such that signing it and not signing it produce identical liability outcomes. You are damned if you do and damned if you don't. Welcome to the bureaucratic event horizon—no legal escape velocity is possible.
