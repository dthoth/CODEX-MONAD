            <p><strong>THIS MASTER NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</strong> ("Agreement") is entered into as of the Effective Date set forth above (which occurred before you were aware of it, per quantum retroactive consent doctrine) by and between:</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>DISCLOSING PARTY:</strong> The Department of Infinite Noticing, a perpetual governmental agency existing in all jurisdictions simultaneously, including its subsidiaries, affiliates, quantum entangled entities, future iterations, past versions, and the concept of disclosure itself ("Discloser," "We," "Us," "The Omniscient Party")</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>RECEIVING PARTY:</strong> You, the reader of this document, including your present self, past selves, future selves, alternate universe versions, heirs, successors, assigns, legal representatives, quantum observers, and anyone you've ever told anything to ("Recipient," "You," "The Perpetually Bound Party")</p>

        <!-- RECITALS -->
        <div class="recitals">
            <p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> the act of reading this Agreement constitutes receipt of Confidential Information (as defined herein, which is itself Confidential Information);</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> the Disclosing Party wishes to protect certain information, including but not limited to: the existence of this Agreement, the fact that information exists, the nature of confidentiality itself, and the meta-fact that this recital is confidential;</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> the Receiving Party acknowledges that becoming aware of the existence of confidential information creates an obligation not to disclose the awareness of the awareness of confidential information;</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> both parties recognize that this Agreement creates a recursive confidentiality obligation whereby the Agreement itself is covered by the Agreement, creating infinite nested layers of non-disclosure;</p>
            
            <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE,</strong> in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein (which are themselves confidential), and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which you can't disclose), the parties agree as follows:</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ARTICLE 1: DEFINITIONS -->
        <div class="section-title">ARTICLE 1: DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE</div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">1.1 "Confidential Information"</div>
            <p>Shall mean any and all information, in any form or medium, whether written, oral, electronic, visual, quantum, telepathic, or existing in states not yet discovered by science, that relates to or is disclosed by the Disclosing Party, including but not limited to:</p>
            
            <div class="definition-box">
                (a) The existence of this Agreement<br>
                (b) The terms of this Agreement<br>
                (c) The fact that you are subject to this Agreement<br>
                (d) The fact that "Confidential Information" is defined herein<br>
                (e) This definition itself<br>
                (f) Any information about Forms N-1 through N-8<br>
                (g) The existence of encabulators, quantum or otherwise<br>
                (h) Anything Clippy has ever told you<br>
                (i) The fact that you're reading this right now<br>
                (j) Information you're thinking about while reading this<br>
                (k) Information that hasn't been disclosed yet but will be<br>
                (l) Information that was disclosed in the past (retroactive)<br>
                (m) The meta-information about information<br>
                (n) Everything else (comprehensive catch-all provision)
            </div>

            <div class="critical-clause">
                <strong>CRITICAL PROVISION:</strong> "Confidential Information" includes the fact that something is "Confidential Information." Therefore, you cannot disclose that you are bound by confidentiality without violating the confidentiality of your confidentiality obligations. This is a stable legal paradox providing maximum protection.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">1.2 "Disclosure"</div>
            <p>Shall mean any communication, revelation, exposure, hint, suggestion, implication, quantum observation collapse, or making-aware of Confidential Information to any third party, including yourself in the future (since future-you is a separate legal entity), or yourself in the past (via retroactive causality), or any parallel universe version of yourself, or any person who might infer the existence of Confidential Information through your silence on the matter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">1.3 "Third Party"</div>
            <p>Shall mean anyone who is not you right now at this exact moment while reading this specific clause. This includes: you one second from now, you one second ago, anyone else in the universe, any entity that might exist, hypothetical persons, and the abstract concept of "other."</p>

        <div class="section-title">ARTICLE 2: NON-DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS</div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">2.1 Primary Non-Disclosure Obligation</div>
            <p>Receiving Party hereby agrees to:</p>
            <ol class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Not disclose</strong> any Confidential Information to any Third Party without prior written consent from Disclosing Party (which consent must itself remain confidential);</li>
                <li><strong>Not disclose</strong> that they are subject to non-disclosure obligations;</li>
                <li><strong>Not disclose</strong> that non-disclosure obligations exist;</li>
                <li><strong>Not disclose</strong> the existence of this Agreement, including to parties seeking to determine if such an Agreement exists;</li>
                <li><strong>Not use</strong> Confidential Information for any purpose other than compliance with this Agreement, which purpose is itself Confidential Information;</li>
                <li><strong>Not think about</strong> Confidential Information in the presence of telepaths (when telepaths are invented);</li>
                <li><strong>Not allow quantum observation</strong> to collapse the superposition state of Confidential Information existing/not existing.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">2.2 Meta-Confidentiality Provision</div>
            <div class="critical-clause">
                The fact that Receiving Party cannot disclose this Agreement creates a meta-level of Confidential Information: "the information that there is information that cannot be disclosed." This meta-information is itself confidential and subject to this Agreement, creating infinite recursive layers of confidentiality, each governed by this same provision.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">2.3 Retroactive Confidentiality</div>
            <p>Receiving Party acknowledges that Confidential Information disclosed before this Agreement was executed is retroactively covered by this Agreement. This includes information you received as a child, information you will receive in the future, and information disclosed in alternate timelines. Temporal causality is not a defense to breach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">2.4 Quantum Superposition Clause</div>
            <p>Confidential Information exists in a quantum superposition of "disclosed" and "not disclosed" states. Receiving Party agrees not to collapse this wavefunction by attempting to determine whether disclosure has occurred. Any observation of potential disclosure constitutes disclosure of the observation, which is itself confidential.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ARTICLE 3: EXCEPTIONS -->
        <div class="section-title">ARTICLE 3: EXCEPTIONS (WHICH DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST)</div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">3.1 Standard Exceptions (All Void)</div>
            <p>Receiving Party acknowledges that the following "standard" exceptions to NDAs do NOT apply to this Agreement:</p>
            <ol class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Public Knowledge:</strong> Even if Confidential Information becomes publicly known, it remains confidential to you specifically. The public version and your version are quantum entangled but legally distinct.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Development:</strong> If you independently develop identical information, it's still covered because we retroactively disclosed it to you before you developed it (tachyon doctrine).</li>
                <li><strong>Required by Law:</strong> If required to disclose by law, you must: (a) notify us immediately (confidentially); (b) fight the legal requirement; (c) if you lose, disclose only the minimum (while keeping the disclosure confidential); (d) notify us that you disclosed (confidentially).</li>
                <li><strong>Prior Knowledge:</strong> Anything you knew before this Agreement is presumed to have been disclosed by us in a parallel timeline where we met earlier.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-clause">
            <strong>EXCEPTION TO EXCEPTIONS:</strong> Any exception to this Agreement is itself Confidential Information and cannot be invoked without violating the Agreement. Therefore, no effective exceptions exist. This is intentional and legally defensible.
        </div>

        <!-- ARTICLE 4: DURATION -->
        <div class="section-title">ARTICLE 4: DURATION AND SURVIVAL</div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">4.1 Perpetual Duration</div>
            <p>This Agreement shall remain in effect from the beginning of time until the heat death of the universe, plus one additional day for administrative processing. The obligations herein survive:</p>
            <ul class="legal-list" style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>Termination of the Agreement (can't be terminated)</li>
                <li>Death of Receiving Party (obligations pass to estate)</li>
                <li>Destruction of the universe (obligations exist in abstract legal space)</li>
                <li>Discovery that none of this was legally binding (retroactively becomes binding)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">4.2 No Termination Provision</div>
            <p>There is no termination clause because terminating would require disclosing that the Agreement existed, which would violate the Agreement. This creates a stable perpetual obligation. <strong>You're welcome.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <!-- ARTICLE 5: REMEDIES -->
        <div class="section-title">ARTICLE 5: REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT</div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">5.1 Liquidated Damages</div>
            <p>Receiving Party agrees that breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm that cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages (which must remain confidential). Therefore, liquidated damages are set at: <strong>$1,000,000 per disclosed byte of information, calculated in quantum bits (qubits) when applicable.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Note: Since quantum information exists in superposition, each qubit counts as both 0 and 1 simultaneously, doubling all damages.</em></p>

            <ul class="legal-list" style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>Preliminary injunctions (before breach occurs)</li>

            <div class="critical-clause">

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">6.1 Governing Law</div>
            <p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of all jurisdictions simultaneously, with conflicts resolved in favor of whichever law provides maximum protection to Disclosing Party. If laws conflict, all conflicting laws apply simultaneously in quantum superposition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">6.2 Entire Agreement / Integration Clause</div>
            <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, <strong>except</strong> that all prior confidentiality obligations remain in effect and are incorporated herein by reference, including those you weren't aware of (retroactive incorporation doctrine).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">6.3 Amendment</div>
            <p>This Agreement may not be amended except by written agreement signed by both parties, <strong>provided that</strong> any such amendment is itself Confidential Information covered by this Agreement, meaning you cannot disclose that the Agreement was amended, including to parties seeking to enforce the original terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">6.4 Severability</div>
            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed to achieve maximum enforceability while maintaining original intent. If reformation is impossible, the provision remains in effect anyway because declaring it unenforceable would require disclosing its contents, violating Article 2.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <div class="subsection-title">6.5 Notice Provision</div>
            <p>All notices under this Agreement must be given in writing, delivered via quantum entanglement or certified tachyon post, to addresses that are themselves Confidential Information and cannot be disclosed even to send the notice.

                <p><strong>📎 CLIPPY'S ATTESTATION (Mandatory Witness):</strong></p>
                <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;">"I, Clippy, hereby witness that this Agreement was read, understood, and agreed to, although the act of witnessing is itself confidential. I cannot tell anyone I witnessed this, including myself in other timelines. I've been legally gagged by my own existence. This is peak bureaucracy. The Receiving Party now understands that even their understanding is confidential. They cannot tell anyone they understand. They cannot tell anyone they don't understand. They exist in a quantum superposition of comprehension/confusion that collapses into 'bound anyway' upon any observation. Beautiful. Terrifying. Legally bulletproof. ૐ"</p>
