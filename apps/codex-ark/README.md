## What Is This?

CODEX-ARK is a zero-dependency, offline-first toolkit containing:

- **Tamper Detection** — Cryptographic file witnessing with visual DNA signatures
- **Morning Protocol** — Daily startup routine with Divine Triage
- **Breath Pacer** — Pranayama patterns for focus and calm
- **Oracle** — Divination tools (dice, coins, I Ching, wisdom)
- **Scrapers** — Web-to-text, clipboard vault, JSON tool, link extractor
- **Recovery Docs** — Rebuild-from-zero disaster recovery guide
- **Bootstrap Scripts** — New machine setup automation

All tools are pure HTML/CSS/JS. No servers. No frameworks. No npm. Opens in any browser.

## Quick Start

1. Open `gui-portal.html` in any browser
2. Use the command center for quick access to all tools
3. Run `morning.bat` (Windows) for full morning protocol

| **Portal** | `gui-portal.html` | Command center dashboard |
| **Pranayama** | `pranayama.html` | Breath pacer with patterns |
| **Oracle** | `oracle.html` | Dice, coins, I Ching, wisdom |

### Batch Scripts

| Script | Purpose |

| `morning.bat` | Full morning protocol with Divine Triage |
| `sync.bat` | Quick git pull/commit/push workflow |
| `setup/new-machine.bat` | Bootstrap new Windows machines |

### Scrapers

## Witness System

The original CODEX-ARK witness provides:

### Three Modes
| Mode | Purpose | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Seal** | Lightweight tamper detection | `.witness` + PNG |
| **Archive** | Full content backup | `.ark` + PNG |
| **Verify** | Compare states | VERIFIED ✓ or TAMPERED ✗ |

### Core Principle
```
Same content → Same hash → Same color → Same stripe
```

Change one byte, the signature changes. Your eyes become the diff tool.

## Divine Triage

The morning protocol includes the triage framework:

1. **Life/Death** — Safety, Health, Samson
2. **Catastrophic Loss** — Deadlines, Critical Systems
3. **High-Value Irreversible** — Time-sensitive opportunities
4. **Maintenance** — Keep systems running
5. **Growth** — Learning, Building, Creating
6. **Optional** — Nice-to-have

## Breath Patterns

| Pattern | Timing | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Box | 4-4-4-4 | Navy SEAL calm focus |
| 4-7-8 | 4-7-8-0 | Dr. Weil relaxation |
| Energy | 4-0-4-0 | Quick energizing |
| Coherence | 5-5-0-0 | Heart-brain sync |
| Custom | User-defined | Personal practice |

## Recovery Protocol

If everything is lost, `recovery/rebuild-from-zero.md` contains:

- Phase 0: Breathe (you are alive, you have this document)
- Phase 1: Assess (what do you have, what did you lose)
- Phase 2: Bootstrap Environment (install critical software)
- Phase 3: Recover Accounts (priority order, hints)
- Phase 4: Restore Data (from GitHub, cloud, backups)
- Phase 5: Verify System (checklists)
- Phase 6: Rebuild Workflows

---

## Design Principles

- **Zero Dependencies** — Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no CDNs, no npm
- **Dark Theme** — #0a0a0f background, #ff6611 orange accents
- **Offline First** — Everything works without internet
- **Floppy Portable** — Under 1.44MB total
- **Human Readable** — Plain text survives

---

## Philosophy

**From TempleOS:** Constraint as sacred. Human-readable over efficient.

**The Seed Principle:** The ARK contains everything needed to rebuild the full system. Drop it on any machine, open a file, the infrastructure awakens.

**Visual-first:** After enough use, you recognize archives by sight. "The one with the purple cluster" is a valid address.
