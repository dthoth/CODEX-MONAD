# Update Your CODEX-MONAD Repository

## Files to Add:
I've created 3 new files for you:
- `index.html` - Main DIN Portal
- `polywrite.html` - PolyWrite writing system  
- `din-files.html` - DIN Files manager

## Using GitHub Desktop (EASIEST):

1. **Download these files:**
   - [index.html](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/index.html)
   - [polywrite.html](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/polywrite.html)
   - [din-files.html](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/din-files.html)

2. **Copy them to your local CODEX-MONAD folder**
   - This is wherever GitHub Desktop created it
   - Probably in `Documents/GitHub/CODEX-MONAD`

3. **Open GitHub Desktop**
   - It will automatically detect the new files
   - You'll see them in the "Changes" tab

4. **Commit the changes:**
   - Summary: "Add DIN Portal, PolyWrite, and DIN Files"
   - Description: "Complete portal system with consciousness file manager and multi-dimensional writing tools"
   - Click "Commit to main"

5. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Click "Push origin" button at the top
   - Done! ✅

## OR Using Terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your CODEX-MONAD folder
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/CODEX-MONAD

# Add the new files (after copying them there)
git add index.html polywrite.html din-files.html

# Commit with message
