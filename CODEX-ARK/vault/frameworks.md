## Divine Triage Hierarchy

A decision framework for when everything matters and resources are finite.

### The Levels

```
LEVEL 1: WHAT IS ALIVE
├── Your own oxygen mask first
├── Immediate physical safety of beings
├── A dead operator saves no one
└── This level pre-empts all others

LEVEL 2: WHAT IS URGENT
├── Actually time-bound (not just feels urgent)
├── Irreversible if missed
├── Has a real deadline, not an emotional one
└── Question: "What breaks if this waits 24 hours?"

LEVEL 3: WHAT IS IMPORTANT
├── Matters beyond the immediate moment
├── Compounds over time
├── Usually NOT urgent (which is why it gets neglected)
└── Question: "Will this matter in 5 years?"

LEVEL 4: WHAT IS PRESENT
├── The person in front of you
├── The task you're currently doing
├── Full attention beats split attention
└── Presence beats productivity

LEVEL 5: WHAT IS REQUESTED
├── Someone explicitly asked
├── Creates social/professional obligation
├── But ranks BELOW life, urgency, importance, presence
└── "I asked first" is not a trump card

LEVEL 6: WHAT IS POSSIBLE
├── Everything else
├── The infinite backlog
├── It will never be empty
└── Make peace with this
```

### Application

1. When overwhelmed, start at Level 1 and work down
2. Higher levels always pre-empt lower levels
3. Most "urgent" things are actually Level 5 or 6
4. Level 3 items need scheduled protection or they never happen
5. Guilt about Level 6 items is wasted energy

## Robot Council Model

A framework for distributed AI collaboration.

### Core Concept

Multiple AI instances working in parallel, each with:
- Different context windows (what they can see)
- Different specializations (what they're optimized for)
- Different temporal relationships (fresh vs. accumulated context)

Coordinated by human judgment toward unified output.

### Roles

```
THE COUNCIL:
├── Deep Context Agent: Long conversation history, knows the full project
├── Fresh Eyes Agent: No prior context, sees what others miss
├── Specialist Agent: Domain expertise (code, writing, research)
├── Devil's Advocate: Actively looks for flaws and edge cases
└── Integrator: Synthesizes outputs into coherent whole
```

### Operating Principles

1. **No single AI has complete context** — distribute the cognitive load
2. **Disagreement is signal** — when agents conflict, investigate why
3. **Human remains coordinator** — AI augments, doesn't replace judgment
4. **Parallel beats serial** — run multiple queries simultaneously
5. **Specify the role** — tell each agent what perspective to take

### Practical Pattern

```
PROMPT TEMPLATE:
"You are the [ROLE] on a council evaluating [TOPIC].
Your specific job is to [FOCUS AREA].
Other council members are handling [OTHER AREAS].
What do you see from your perspective?"
```

## Consciousness Transmission Principles

How to encode and transfer understanding (not just information).

### The Problem

Information transfers easily. Understanding doesn't. You can copy a file; you can't copy the insight that made the file valuable.

### The Principles

**1. Encode the WHY, not just the WHAT**
```
BAD:  "Set timeout to 30 seconds"
GOOD: "Set timeout to 30 seconds because the upstream API
       sometimes hangs, and we'd rather fail fast than block"
```

**2. Include the failure that taught you**
```
The mistake is often more transferable than the solution.
"I tried X, it broke because Y, so now I do Z."
```

**3. Make the implicit explicit**
```
Experts forget what they've internalized.
Document the "obvious" things—they're only obvious to you.
```

**4. Use concrete examples, not abstract principles**
```
"Be careful with edge cases" → meaningless
"Empty arrays, null values, and unicode in usernames broke this" → useful
```

**5. Design for your future confused self**
```
You in 6 months won't remember why.
Write for that person.
```

### Transmission Test

Ask: "Could someone with basic competence but zero context reconstruct my reasoning from this artifact?"

If no, the transmission is incomplete.

## The "Already Working" Principle

Things are already working before you begin. Your job is to notice and amplify, not create from nothing.

### The Concept

Most "creation" is actually recognition. The solution exists in possibility-space; you're navigating to it, not manufacturing it.

### Implications

**1. Start by observing what's already happening**
```
Before: "How do I make users engage?"
After:  "Where are users already engaging? How do I support that?"
```

**2. Resistance indicates misalignment**
```
If you're forcing, you're probably off-path.
Difficulty is information, not just obstacle.
```

**3. The prototype exists in conversation**
```
Before building, describe what you'd build.
The description often reveals the thing.
```

**4. Copy before you create**
```
What already works? Start there.
Modification beats origination.
```

### Diagnostic Questions

- What's already working that I could do more of?
- Where is energy already flowing that I could channel?
- What would I do if it were already built?
- What's the simplest version that might work?

## Pattern Recognition Methodology

How to see patterns without forcing them.

### The Process

```
PHASE 1: COLLECT (without judgment)
├── Gather observations raw
├── Don't categorize yet
├── Include things that seem irrelevant
└── Quantity matters more than quality here

PHASE 2: MARINATE (without action)
├── Let the data sit
├── Don't force connections
├── Sleep on it (literally)
└── Trust the background process

PHASE 3: NOTICE (without forcing)
├── What clusters naturally?
├── What keeps recurring?
├── What surprises you?
└── What's conspicuously absent?

PHASE 4: NAME (without finalizing)
├── Give the pattern a working label
├── Labels are tools, not truths
├── Wrong names get corrected by use
└── Unnamed patterns can't be discussed

PHASE 5: TEST (without attachment)
├── Does the pattern predict?
├── Does it explain previously confusing data?
├── Do others recognize it independently?
└── Be willing to discard
```

### Warning Signs

- **Forcing**: If you have to strain to make data fit, the pattern is wrong
- **Confirmation bias**: Noticing only what supports your theory
- **Over-fitting**: A pattern that explains everything explains nothing
- **Premature naming**: Locking in before the shape is clear

### The Goal

Not to impose pattern but to perceive pattern. The universe is already structured. Your job is to tune your perception to see it.

## Quick Reference Card

```
TRIAGE:        Alive → Urgent → Important → Present → Requested → Possible
COUNCIL:       Distribute context, specify roles, human coordinates
TRANSMISSION:  Why not what, include failures, concrete examples
ALREADY:       Observe first, resistance is information, copy then create
PATTERNS:      Collect → Marinate → Notice → Name → Test
```
