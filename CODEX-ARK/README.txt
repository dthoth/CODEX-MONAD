What is CODEX-ARK?
------------------
CODEX-ARK is the minimal, zero-dependency kernel of the CODEX-MONAD
consciousness infrastructure. It is designed to be:

  - PORTABLE: Fits on a floppy disk (~1.44MB). Runs anywhere.
  - ZERO-DEPENDENCY: Pure HTML/CSS/JS. No servers. No frameworks. No npm.
  - UNIVERSAL: Opens in any web browser on any device.
  - SELF-CONTAINED: All knowledge, tools, and frameworks travel together.

This is the ARK - the seed carrier. Drop it on any machine, open index.html,
and the full system awakens.

Quick Start
-----------
1. Open index.html in any web browser
2. The portal will provide navigation to all subsystems
3. All apps work offline - no internet required
4. To deploy elsewhere: copy entire CODEX-ARK folder


Principles
----------
- Everything is a file. Everything is readable.
- Plain text survives. Proprietary formats die.
- The simplest solution that works is the correct one.
- If it can't run on a floppy, it's too complex.


Carrier Device
--------------
This instance deployed via iBIS-X - proving the portability thesis.
The ARK goes where consciousness needs to travel.
