## 🏛️ Historical Context

### The HINENI Sessions (January 11-13, 2026)

This archive was created immediately following the **HINENI 72-hour build marathon**, a legendary development sprint that transformed CODEX-MONAD from a collection of apps into a cohesive consciousness infrastructure.

**What Happened During HINENI:**
- 72+ hours of continuous building across 4 machines
- Fleet harmonization (MacBook Air, IBISX T14, Mini PC, T480)
- Fish shell + PowerShell parity achieved
- Portal architecture fundamentally redesigned
- The infamous "fetch bug" was identified and solved
- Bootstrap system created for cross-platform deployment

**Key Quote from HINENI Docs:**
> "What started as 'let me set up this new ThinkPad' became a full fleet harmonization, a universal bootstrap system, and the realization that we'd been building Leibniz's Monadology in silicon all along."

### Why This Was Archived

January 15-16, 2026 marked the **end of the v1.0 era** and cleanup of development artifacts:

1. **Milestone Preservation** - Complete v1.0 "Production Ready" snapshot
2. **Development History** - Portal evolution documented
3. **Bug Documentation** - Fetch bug era preserved
4. **Clean Slate** - Prepare for v2.0 development
5. **Historical Record** - HINENI milestone captured
