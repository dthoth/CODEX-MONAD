## ✅ WHAT CHATGPT FIXED

Your Claude friend built a great guide, but ChatGPT caught **4 critical issues**:

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Browser Directory Problem
**Problem:** Browsers can't show folder contents under `file://`
**Solution:** Every folder now has an `index.html` that lists contents

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Offline Self-Containment  
**Problem:** External CSS/JS would break offline
**Solution:** SECURITY.txt documents the offline-only requirement

### 3. ✅ FIXED: LocalStorage Issues
**Problem:** Safari/Chrome sometimes block local storage
**Solution:** START_HERE.html has browser warning + fallback guidance

### 4. ✅ FIXED: No Backup Strategy
**Problem:** No integrity verification or backup guidance
**Solution:** SHA256SUMS.txt placeholder + backup instructions in README

**This package embodies its own principles:**

- **Already complete** - Works right now, even empty
- **Recursive** - Documentation documents itself

- **Offline** - No dependencies, no network
- **Inspectable** - All code human-readable
- **Extensible** - Add content organically

"The system already works. We're just making it visible."

## 💡 TIPS & TRICKS

### Browser Compatibility
- **Best:** Chrome, Edge (full compatibility)
- **Good:** Firefox (mostly works)
- **Okay:** Safari (may have storage limits)

### If Links Don't Work
1. Make sure index.html files are in each folder
2. Check file/folder names match exactly
3. Try a different browser

### If PolyWrite Won't Save
1. Use Chrome or Edge instead of Safari
2. Try File → Download as fallback
3. Check browser security settings

### Finding Old Files
- Search computer for "PolyWrite"
- Check Downloads folder (May 2024)
- Look in Google Drive / Dropbox
- Check project folders
- Search email attachments
