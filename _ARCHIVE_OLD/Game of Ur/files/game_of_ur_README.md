## The Oracle

Each bird governs a domain of fortune. As you play, the Oracle Log builds your reading:

- **Land on a rosette**: Positive fortune
- **Pass over a rosette**: Negative fortune
- **Complete the journey**: Your bird's domain is fulfilled

The pattern of fortunes received—which birds entered, which struggled, which landed true—forms the message from fate.

**Date:** 177-176 BC  
**Translation:** Dr. Irving Finkel

This tablet contains the only surviving complete rules for an ancient board game, plus a zodiac grid for fortune-telling. The twelve central squares correspond to the twelve signs of the zodiac, suggesting the board represented the heavens and the pieces represented planets.
