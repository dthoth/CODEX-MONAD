## 🔧 Configuration

### localStorage Keys
Each app stores data in localStorage with prefixed keys:
- `polywrite_*` - PolyWrite data
- `pranayama_*` - Breathing sessions
- `oracle_*` - Oracle queries
- `samson_*` - Learning progress
- `bureaucratic_*` - Forms data
- `din_*` - File metadata

### Clearing Data
To reset an app, clear its localStorage:
```javascript
// Clear specific app data
Object.keys(localStorage)
  .filter(key => key.startsWith('polywrite_'))
  .forEach(key => localStorage.removeItem(key));

// Or clear everything
localStorage.clear();
```

## 🔮 Philosophy & Concepts

### The Shebang Principle
"Already working before you begin" - The system is self-referential and recursive, containing its own documentation and purpose.

### Quantum Consciousness
Every interaction creates branching timelines. The apps don't just store data; they create probability fields of potential states.

### Recursive Learning
Understanding that leads to understanding understanding. Each level of interaction reveals deeper patterns.

### Bureaucratic Enlightenment
Forms and documents as consciousness tools. Organization as a path to transcendence.
