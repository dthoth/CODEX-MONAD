## 🔄 Fleet Sync

CODEX-MONAD supports seamless synchronization across multiple devices:

```
   MacBook Air ←──→ GitHub ←──→ FORGE (ThinkPad)
        ↑                            ↑
        └────────→ Mini PC ←─────────┘
```

**How it works:**
1. Notes and wisdom save to `data/user-sync/`
2. `ship` pushes to GitHub
3. `sync` pulls to other devices
4. Your thoughts exist everywhere

See [docs/FLEET-SYNC.md](docs/FLEET-SYNC.md) for setup instructions.

## 🧠 Philosophy

CODEX-MONAD is built on several key principles:

### The Monad (Leibniz, 1714)
A self-contained, windowless unit that reflects the universe internally. Each instance is complete in itself.

### HINENI (הנני)
Hebrew for "Here I Am" — complete, present, self-sufficient. The system announces its own presence and readiness.

### Charge on Delivery
Systems prove their worth through results, not promises. Every feature must work before it ships.

### The Floppy Constraint
Originally designed to fit on a 1.44MB floppy disk. Constraints breed creativity. Simplicity is strength.

### Divine Triage
A priority hierarchy for decision-making:
1. Health
2. Parenting  
3. Clients
4. Projects
5. Creative
6. Maintenance

---

## 🐉 Dragon Wisdom

The system includes a fortune system drawing from:
- Programming wisdom
- Stoic philosophy
- Pop culture
- Original CODEX aphorisms

Run `dragon` anytime. Run `keeper` to preserve the good ones.

> "Git push is a prayer. Git pull is an answer."
